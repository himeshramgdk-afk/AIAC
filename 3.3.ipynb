        "*   The initial vague prompt \"Generate python code to calculate power bill\" resulted in a basic function assuming a fixed rate per kWh (\\$0.15) with no input validation.\n",
        "*   Refining the prompt to include `kwh_used` and `rate_per_kwh` as inputs led to an improved function that takes these arguments and calculates the bill, adding basic error handling for negative inputs.\n",
        "*   Further refining the prompt to include a `fixed_charge` resulted in a more detailed function that calculates the bill by multiplying `kwh_used` by `rate_per_kwh` and adding the `fixed_charge`, while maintaining error handling for negative values across all inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Subsequent iterations could include more complex billing structures such as tiered pricing based on consumption levels or the addition of taxes and other fees to create a more comprehensive power bill calculation.\n",
        "*   Consider implementing more robust error handling, such as raising exceptions for invalid input types instead of returning a string message.\n"
